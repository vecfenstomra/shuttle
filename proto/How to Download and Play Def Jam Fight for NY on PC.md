Another way to spend your dev points is to learn new fighting styles. There are five styles in total: street fighting, kickboxing, martial arts, wrestling, and submissions. Each style has its own advantages and disadvantages, and you can combine up to three styles to create your own unique fighter. However, learning new styles is not as important as training your skills, especially in the early stages of the game. You can beat most opponents with just one or two styles, as long as you have high stats and good blaze moves. Learning new styles is more useful for adding variety and fun to your gameplay, but it is not essential for winning.
 
The last way to spend your dev points is to learn new blaze moves. Blaze moves are powerful finishing moves that can instantly KO your opponent if they are low on health. You can only use blaze moves when your momentum meter is full, which you can fill by landing attacks and taunting your opponent. You can learn up to four blaze moves, and you can choose which one to use by pressing different directions on the right analog stick. Blaze moves are very useful for ending fights quickly and earning more respect points, but they are also very expensive to learn. You should only learn blaze moves after you have trained your skills sufficiently and learned the styles you want.
 
Now that you know how to spend your dev points wisely, you need to know how to earn them efficiently. The best way to earn dev points is to win fights with style and flair. You can earn more dev points by performing a variety of moves, using environmental hazards, activating blaze mode, and KOing your opponent with a blaze move. You can also earn more dev points by fighting in different venues, challenging different opponents, and completing side missions. The more dev points you earn, the faster you can improve your fighter and dominate the underground scene.
